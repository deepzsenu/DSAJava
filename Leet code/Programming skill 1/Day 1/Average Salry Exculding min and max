class Solution {
    public double average(int[] salary) {
        int min =Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int max = 0;
        int sum= 0;
        for(int i =0; i<salary.length; i++){
            if(salary[i] < min){
                min = salary[i];
            }
            if( salary[i] > max){
                max = salary[i];
            }
            sum+=salary[i];
        }
        double ave = (sum -(min+max)+0.0)/(salary.length-2)+0.0;
        return ave;
    }
